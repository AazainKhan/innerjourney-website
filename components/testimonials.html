                        I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Shanila for the strength and unwavering support she provided during an incredibly challenging period in my life. Diagnosed with Breast Cancer in April 2021, the prospect of a long and uncertain journey ahead was daunting. However, through Shanila's eye-opening sessions, I found the courage to navigate this journey, soothing internal turbulence and gaining a renewed perspective on my situation.

                        With immense gratitude, I express my thanks to Shanila for significantly aiding in my healing journey. I contacted her during a grim phase after losing my parents to COVID-19, I was shattered and miserable, and the loss created a void within. Shanila's approach to addressing my anxiety and insecurities, along with her considerate, patient, yet challenging questions, allowed me to look deep into myself. Her sessions instilled confidence, encouraging me to own my behavior and gain a clearer perspective on ongoing issues. Her sessions helped me learn to respond to my needs with calmness and acceptance. I highly recommend her non-judgmental and patient coaching to those seeking support in challenging nonsupportive behaviour and outlook and taking action to become a better version of oneself.

                        I want to express my gratitude to Shanila for her guidance and help. My daughter had been unwell for almost a year and a half, and despite seeing numerous doctors, her condition was not improving. One of my friends suggested to contact Shanila. She took the details and the very next day on Zoom, she explained the reason for my daughter's illness and advised a few remedies. I felt at ease to know nothing serious to worry about, but she gave me an approximate timeline for my daughter's recovery. She asked not to worry, but to continue the medication. Since then, I have been in touch with her. I am impressed with her accurate readings for me and my family. She is positive and realistic with her approach. I highly recommend her numerology services to anyone in need of guidance.

                        I was overwhelmed and extremely disappointed with my life when I contacted Shanila. 17 years was a long time to stay in an unhealthy and chaotic married life. She did the readings of my husband and my numerology charts, and her findings indicated that our marriage would end in a few months, which turned out to be true when my husband told me he had met someone else and wanted to end the marriage. Shanila's predictions were accurate, and I separated in July 2017. As a single mother, I am now raising my daughter who is studying in the USA, and I am happy and grateful to have had Shanila as my guide. I highly recommend her to anyone facing tough times and in need of guidance and motivation. She is approachable and reliable.

                        In April 2023, I contacted Shanila after a friend from Dubai recommended her. I was planning to start a business in partnership but there were constant delays that were bothering me. Shanila asked for details about my partner and me and did a reading. She gave me the timeline and when things will start moving in that direction in October 2023. She also predicted that the business would open by mid-2024. I'm happy to report that we're opening in May 2024, and I'm glad I reached out to her. If you're feeling overwhelmed and demotivated, I highly recommend reaching out to Shanila for her guidance.

                        It was 2015 when my husband and I were facing a difficult time in Dubai in our careers for quite some time. We were uncertain whether to stay in Dubai or to go back India or move to Canada. In the middle of this chaos, we sought assistance from Shanila mam who provided us with insights based on our DOB and name reading (numerology reading) and helped us plan for the coming years. Her readings were accurate and gave us hope for a great future. With her guidance, we gained clarity to plan our future. She told us there is a bright possibility of moving to Canada. And in 2017 it turned out to be the best decision of our lives when we reached Canada. Today, we celebrate our success and recognize how the challenges we faced contributed to our journey. I express eternal gratitude to Shanila mam whose intervention at that time turned the table around and we confidently stepped forward with our plan. I highly recommend her services in numerology.
